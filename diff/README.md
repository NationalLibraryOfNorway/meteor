## Diff script ##
This is a simple script to compare selected fields from one version of Meteor against the current
version. The script will output the results of the diff to the console. Make sure to set the value of the
`DIFF_FILES_FOLDER` variable in the *.env* file to a valid path.

### Getting the `previous_results.json` file
The `previous_results.json` file is the file that contains the results of the previous diff.
To create this file do the following:
- Using git, checkout the version of Meteor you want to compare against
- Run `python diff/run_prev_diff.py` from the root directory of the project
- The script will save the results of the diff to `/diff/previous_results.json`
- Checkout to your desired branch
- Run the diff script (see below)

### How to run the diff
The diff is run by executing the following command from root directory of the project:

``` python diff/evaluate_current_version.py -f <field> [-c] ```

If `field` is not recognized, or the cache option `-c` is used before a result json file is produced,
the script will fail. Otherwise the program will output the results of the diff to the console.
